    	<blockquote> " 'It is a sign of aphuia' says he,–that is, of a nature not finely tempered,–'to give yourselves up to things which relate to the body; to make, for instance, a great fuss about exercise, a great fuss about eating, a great fuss about drinking, a great fuss about walking, a great fuss about riding. All these things ought to be done merely by the way: the formation of the spirit and character must be our real concern.' This is admirable; and, indeed, the Greek words aphuia, euphuia,+ a finely tempered nature, a coarsely tempered nature, give exactly the notion of perfection as culture brings us to conceive of it: a perfection in which the characters of beauty and intelligence are both present..."

	<h2>Past</h2> 
    <p>I was a non-traditional educator, creating and facilitating public programs, tours, and summer camps for ages 4-18 at Children's Theater of Madison Summer Drama School, Wisconsin Historical Museum, and Madison Children's Museum.</p> 
    <p>I've also supervised visitor services and coordinated events at McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum, The Art Insitute of Chicago, and Madison Children's Museum.

<div class=column>   
	<h2>Present</h2>
	<p>I manage events at Overture Center for the Arts</p>
    <p>I can stand longer than I can sit.</p>
    <p>I cook because I like only delicious food.</p>
    <p>I am a friend to all animals, but afraid of horses.</p>
   <!-- <p>I watch <em>all</em> the television.</p> -->
    <p>I watch most of the festival movies, and make my own short ones.</p>
    <p>I read many old books, and write very new poems.</p>
    <p>I learn.</p>
</div>
<div class=column> 
	<h2>Future</h2>
    <p>I'm interested in fostering kindness and learning in the newest people (children!), non-profit management, streaming television production, film festival operations, and web curation. </p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to have a life in which I own at least three chickens and one dog.
