<!--[To be posted when all sites have similar blurbs]    <p>I created the blog when I was an Education Program Assistant at MCM at the request of the exhibit coordinator, Julie King. I developed and facilitated several educational public programs that became staples of the exibit. </p>
     <p>The blog grew from the ground up, with busy parents often inquiring about where they could get more information about our activities. The blog also became a great place for parents to obtain copies of the photos taken on the Rooftop that featured their children. </p> 
     <p>I chose Tumblr to host the blog for many reasons. As a content management system, it is much easier to use than its counterparts like Wordpress. While Wordpress (arguably) has more options for the more experienced developer, the visual editor in Tumblr provides enough tools for those without HTML knowledge to publish a good post without getting confused. The Rooftop Ramble hosts three to four interns each semester, so ease of use was paramount as differnt people would post, and not have much time to do so. The blog was kept up for a few months after I left my position in the Education Department for a promotion to Visitor Services Supervisor. Unfortunately, the blog has ceased to be updated.</p>
