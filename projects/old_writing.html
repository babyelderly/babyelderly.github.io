<p>Du Bois believes that the inherently different outlook of a repressed people allows for an alternate worldview, “you realize this sooner than the average white American because, pushed aside as we have been in America, there has come to us not only a certain distaste for the tawdry and flamboyant but a vision of what the world could be if it were really a beautiful world...” (753). Being outside not only the ruling class, but really also the masses—the colored people of America still at the time lacked the basic rights of even the poorest white American. With so much lack comes the ability to appreciate simpler delights because it is one’s only option—a beautiful natural scene, the quality of light at sunset, et cetera. “A single phrase of music in the Southern South” is not an elaborate composition brought to life by many working in unison at expensive instruments mastered over a lifetime—beauty need not be expensive. When Du Bois writes of the infinite nature of Beauty, “in normal life all may have it and have it yet again,” he reminds us that no one owns the sunset, a fact that may seem obvious, but is actually fairly revelatory as it opposes the commodification of beauty.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant ways that capitalism has degraded human life is the notion that one must pay for beauty. Advertising making-up, blush for example, is essentially extolling the virtues of it. There is not inherent virtue is pink powder (in fact, make-up is quite harmful to the skin). The make-up companies invent flaw in pushing their product. As an American woman firmly footed in mass culture (unfortunately?), I am told what is natural for me is not ideal, and that I should strive to alter and conform. One of the most effective ways of doing this is that notion of conformity: Everyone else looks like this and it’s great, let me help you! Everyone does not have a natural blush. In fact, only a small number of the human population, the fairest of our species, maintain a rouge cheek at rest. For the majority of humans a flush only comes through physical excursion. Telling me that beautiful, healthy skin is one that lacks pigment to such a degree that, being nearly translucent, underlying blood is visible is pretty outrageous. Why does it seem normal to we, the masses? In a capitalist structure, in order to gain wealth, I must take some wealth away from another person—the buying and selling that is The Free Market. Humans have an inherent appreciation for Beauty, so the capitalist mind epiphanizes the ultimate sell. “The world is full of [beauty]; and yet today the mass of human beings are choked away from it, and their lives distorted and made ugly. This is not only wrong, it is silly,” (754). What you already have cannot be sold to you, so they tell us we don’t have it. The ruling class might have convinced its masses, but forcible kept outside by racial prejudice, he sees that black people have the opportunity to think for themselves and realize that beauty cannot be denied to any.</p>
<p>Du Bois then goes on to discuss the merits of the arts, “[...] we are going to have a real and valuable and eternal judgment only as we make ourselves free of mind, proud of body and just of soul to all men” (758). He believes the arts can advance or restrain a people. Essentially, the lack of art is the equivalent of a lack of voice. “What would people in a hundred years say of black American?” is the question that motivates his view of art as propaganda. He discusses how in order for black art to be legitimate, black people need to embrace it. That is all well and good, but I can’t help feeling that he has abandoned the most revolutionary aspect of his piece:

<blockquote>We black folk may help for we have within us as a race new stirrings; stirrings of the beginning of a new appreciation of joy, of a new desire to create, of a new will to be; as though in this morning of group life we had awakened from some sleep....” (754).</blockquote>
<p>He has made the claim that black people have an advantage through their disadvantage in being able to see the trappings of materialistic white America. I think that is so right, but instead of upending the system, he seeks to work within it: white people have art, we should have art and there the problem is solved? Marx would see flaws in Du Bois ideas applied to the real life of the time. This is not true change. It’s a revolution within the existing system. Du Bois shares his notion of an ideal society, an ideal life: 
<blockquote>
<img src="../images/dubois_quote.png" alt="Screen shot of the following text from Du Bois's Critique of Negro Art[...]if we had, to be sure, not perfect happiness, but plenty of good hard work, the inevitable suffering that always comes with life; sacrifice and waiting, all that--but, nevertheless, lived in a world where men know, where men create, where they realize themselves and where they enjoy life. It is that sort of a world we want to create for ourselves and for all America." title="Du Bois quote" width="552" height="125" />
</blockquote>
Even though there are new ideas—exultation of beauty, a life compatible with enjoyment of the beautiful, group work so no one is overwhelmed—it cannot occur within the existing system. And we know, being at the advantaged end of history, that real change never did come.</p>
<p>While black art propaganda has been successful in advancing the position of some black people, this is winning the battle and losing the war. It is progress that the president of the United States is black. It is progress that the most admired pop icon, Beyoncé, is black. But it is progress within the capitalist system. This progress also resulted in people
￼
of color being just as “choked” of beauty as the white mass. Working within and by the existing system resulted only, exactly as Marx predicted, in creating a new ruling class. Our culture is the same as that of 1920s America except now people of color are in the ruling class. People of color have gained the power to oppress others, and have lost the huge advantage they had to the white mass—that view outside the manipulation of the “camera obscura” to see the bounty of the free and natural. If anything, we can say that the current state is one, like mold in the damp dark, that has been nourished by the reinforcement by oppressed peoples of the most corrupting powers of capitalism. I wonder, then, as Du Bois did, “who shall let this world be beautiful? Who shall restore to men the glory of sunsets and the peace of quiet sleep?” (754).

	<h4>"Revenge: The Gentleman’s Pursuit"</h4>
	<p>Revenge entails all the mechanisms of vindictive action against another for perceived slights. Wuthering Heights is focused on the etiology of revenge: a back and forth between the effects of love, the effects of loss, and the character’s struggles to reconcile them. Negotiation of life’s greater abstracts, love and death, is all that life is to the inhabitants of the world of this novel; and none more so than Heathcliff who was allowed to know little else.  One’s environment, and the people surrounding—that is the society that sets the expectations one pursues or neglects. The highest level of society Heathcliff had entrée to was that of the two neighboring families, the Earnshaws at Wuthering Heights and the Lintons at Thrushcross Grange. Society to Heathcliff was entirely contained in these two places. Without any other point of reference, Heathcliff must believe that the pursuit of love and revenge in equal passion is the highest goal of a man’s life. Heathcliff’s use of revenge was not an assertion of his individuality, but exactly the opposite. In exacting revenge on those who would oppose him, Heathcliff was conforming to societal norms as he knew them. The only men Heathcliff could look to, as models of society, as gentlemen, were the Earnshaws. Revenge was a gentleman’s pursuit according to what he learned at the Heights. 
	</p>
	<p>Soon into the story, Mr. Lockwood accurately sizes up his landlord, “‘He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl. Do you know anything of his history?’” (28). We here learn that one is not born mean-spirited, but made so by both “ups” and “downs”.  One must have experienced happiness and its lack to become hardened and derive pleasure from the pain of others. This is an important point that the less insightful characters never grasp, and so blame and discard Heathcliff as inherently evil. Heathcliff’s formative years were spent in the tension of “ups and downs”—playing on the moors with Catherine as the favorite of his adoptive father, and later earning his keep working “as hard as any other lad on the farm” under the reign of Hindley (36). What he learned from the former was kindness only to those who deserve it, pursuit of what one wants without consideration of others, and elimination of those who would oppose one. As far as Heathcliff knew, in the isolation of the Yorkshire moors, these must be the qualities of a gentleman. On the first page of the novel in Heathcliff’s first integration with his new tenant, he declares, “I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!” He, and by extension Brontë, takes the first occasion available to him to assert that anyone in the land is there by his invitation, at his discretion, just as Mr. Earnshaw would have it. 
	</p>
<p>Though Nelly and Mrs. Earnshaw wondered “how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bains to feed and fend for,” Mr. Earnshaw never gave the huge imposition on his family of adopting Heathcliff a second’s consideration. Everyone at Wuthering Heights was there by his invitation, at his discretion, and to contest this fact meant opening oneself to a world of misery:
		<blockquote>“A nothing vexed him, and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This was especially to be remarked if anyone attempted to impose upon, or domineer over, his favorite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him, seeming to have got into his hear the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn” (32).  
		</blockquote>
>Not only did he not acquiesce to the wishes of his family, but also he also harshly condemned those who would oppose his wishes. Nelly saw how Mr. Earnshaw made Hindley, his blood, “regard [him] as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent’s affections and his privileges, and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries” (31). Observing his father figure, Heathcliff learned that one should not be swayed away from doing what one thinks is right to accommodate the feelings of others. Mr. Earnshaw was the original tyrant. What proved to be his ultimate suffering—the hatred between his blood son and his adopted treasure—grew from the seed of his own neglect. The sunshine of Mr. Earnshaw’s love was focused narrowly on Heathcliff, while Hindley and Catherine yearned for nourishment in the damp dark. Their father’s attention was only caught through acts of torture upon Heathcliff:
		<blockquote>Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored; then, both began searching their father’s pockets for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud, and Cathy, when she learnt the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing, earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners (30).
    	</blockquote>
Brontë is very careful here to note that the children were fine until they were shown disregard by their beloved father. Hindley is quick to see that earnest expression of his feelings, his tears, brings him nowhere with his father—it is only when Cathy teases Heathcliff “grinning and spitting” that Mr. Earnshaw reacts. He can’t help but notice that Cathy’s teasing of Heathcliff does, however, earn a response. In this way, the mold of vengeance and selfish preservation corrupted the Earnshaw children. Nelly tells a rapt Lockwood how Hindley “grew bitter with brooding over these injuries” (31). 
	</p>
	<p>The Earnshaws, harsh as they seem, cannot function without love. Hindley was much worse off in this way than Cathy as he grew up almost entirely without love. Cathy was not entirely stunted in the deprivation of her father’s love because she received a kind of unconditional love from Heathcliff. However, her ability to love unconditionally was curbed by the highly conditional love offered from her father. She in turn determined that love in general was conditional, and that Heathcliff was exceptional, and therefore irreplaceable, in his offer of unconditional love. We can understand, then, why she was so unwilling to give up the only familial love she had:
		<blockquote>My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable (64).
		</blockquote>
It was clear to Catherine why she needed both Heathcliff and Edgar—their offers of love, agape and eros, were so different in her mind. Catherine does not seek revenge because she has the love she needs: “‘The event of this evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! […] I’ll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything, hereafter!’” (78). The ambiguity derived by the use of “his folly” instead of “Edgar’s follow” reaffirms the diversity of slights dolt by all the men around her. The reader is at first unclear as, in this story of convoluted tragedy “his” could mean Heathcliff, could mean Hindley. 
	</p>
 	<p>As a model of power, Hindely proved how profitable ruthlessness could be.  Nelly relates to Lockwood how “Hindley became tyrannical” based on the feelings of his wife (36). He has stepped into the role of his father with Heathcliff, mediating his actions based on the perceived feelings of another. There could be no doubt that the master of Wuthering Heights should get what he desired. Putting his siblings in their place, Cathy remembers an encounter with her brother:
		<blockquote>‘You forget you have a master here,' says the tyrant. 'I'll demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances, darling, pull his hair as you go by; I heard him snap his fingers,’ (17). 
    	</blockquote>
As the subject of Hindley’s profound hatred, Heathcliff felt the full force of Hindley’s power. While not quite Stockholm syndrome, this experience of forced subordination brought about a kind of admiration. He saw the means to power. Hindley’s actions would be a guide for Heathcliff in reaching his goals. Even Hindley’s sense of humor informed the Heathcliff’s as Lockwood discovers: “I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his humour took that turn,” (7). The only way to be happy outside of love is to inflict pain. The way to laughter, and anything else you want, is in demeaning others. 
	</p>
	<p>Brontë presents the marriage of Hindely and Frances as illogical, describing Frances, via Nelly, as a rather unusual choice of a wife for Hindley. What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father (35). Hindley’s choice not advance in society via marriage, is peculiar given his clear recommendation of the concept to his sister. Bronte shows us little to recommend Frances, and yet she has Edgar fall apart upon her death. How do we reconcile his deep affection for her? An affection that apparently was sustaining him—without it he cannot function? It is because this is the only love he ever received. Thus he held the affections of his wife, Frances, in the highest regard, and fell apart when she died. Heathcliff got all the love Mr. Earnshaw had to give, and with the death of Hindley’s mother, he was left with none. Not even a sister’s love. As the immediate rival for his father’s affection, Heathcliff was not an option for a friend. Hindley hardens a bit when his father died, but even more so with the death of his only love. Hindely’s sole pursuit is the dulling of his pain through focused hatred, scheming to architect Heathcliff’s downfall. Hindley tells Heathcliff’s new wife, Isabella Linton, his designs soon into her residence at the Heights:
		<blockquote>“What has Heathcliffe done to you?” I asked. “In what has he wronged you to warrant this appaling hatred? Wouldn’t it be wiser to bid him quit the house?” 
“No,” thundered Earnshaw; “should he offer to leave me, he’s a dead man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose all, without a change of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh, damnation! I will have it back; and I’ll have his gold, too; and then his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before!” (110).
		</blockquote>
Heathcliff follows this path. He discounts Edgar as a friend who could have been a guide to him because he is a rival to the affection he desires, that of Catherine’s love. Also parallel is Heathcliff’s reaction to the loss of his dearest love, Catherine. Heathcliff foreshadows his unraveling in grief to Catherine on her deathbed: "Is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?" He focuses all his attention on the destruction of his rival, Edgar as Hindley focused so on him.
	</p>
	<p>While Edgar Linton was certainly considered a gentleman by society, standing in such contrast to the values cultivated at the Heights made him a weak role model. There were few opportunities for Heathcliff to get to know Edgar. The only significant time they spent together was when Edgar had already been presented as a rival. Nelly astutely points out the impossibility of friendship between rivals to Catherine, who sees no reason for Edgar to not be friends with Heathcliff: 
		<blockquote>What use is it praising Heathcliff to him? […] As lads they had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised—it’s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between them (77). 
        </blockquote>
hat they could have been friends otherwise is doubtful. What little Heathcliff did know of Edgar did not in any way recommend him. The culture and wealth in which the Lintons grew up seemed to have succeeded only in making the “petted things” ungrateful, boring, and pathetic (38). Relating his first encounter with the Linton’s to Nelly, Heathcliff is already convinced of their inferiority when he says,  “‘I’d not exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton’s at Thrushcross Grange—not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley’s blood!’” (38). Heathcliff was like a sponge, and being so perceptive, saw immediately the trappings the Linton lifestyle, he asks Nelly, “When would you catch me wishing what Catherine wanted? Or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room?” He deftly notes the lack of intimacy and imagination between society’s favored children. 
	</p>
	<p>By introducing the Lintons through Heathcliff, Brontë shows us the ordinarily exalted virtues of the upper class in a different light. Using Heathcliff as her avatar, Brontë shares her own distaste for the performance of propriety. Casting a “gipsy” as her protagonist emphasizes a view of herself and her opinions as outsider. Holding society’s expectations hostage, Wuthering Heights tells the tale of a true romance, fraught with all the complications and misinterpretations of reality. Lockwood praises what he deems a county virtue when he says, “They do live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less in the surface change, and frivolous external things,” (49). By having Lockwood state that the country folk escape the superficiality of society in their remoteness in a pretentious way, Brontë presents her opinion as fact while also showcasing the flaws of city gentlemen.
    </p>
	<p>The brief encounters with those deemed by society to be true gentlemen were overshadowed by the much stronger familial influences of the Earnshaw men. As “a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman” Heathcliff experienced the highest level of society he would be permitted to at Wuthering Heights. He was in with the country gentry only because of Mr. Earnshaw’s deep sympathy for him. This would not be the case when he left the Heights. We are not told what happens while Heathcliff is away, but are lead to believe it was unsavory as England at this time would not be welcoming to someone with his appearance and no one to recommend him. Therefore, the only “society” he knew, and we can say the highest level of society he was admitted to, was that of the Earnshaws and Lintons. With so little exposure to the Linton’s, and Edgar and Isabella’s many flaws which seemed to be a direct result of their upbringing, the expectations he aspired to and did meet where those of Mr. Earnshaw and Hindley, who both showed that one’s time should be spent in the pursuit of love, enjoyment of it, sorrow over its loss, and the cultivation of a particularly vengeful hatred to all who stand in the path to love.</p>
<p>Even young Catherine, both bred and raised to the utmost gentility, became as a result of her tenure at the Heights, the characteristically bitter, mean, that everyone else who lived there without love was. Only in love can we find solace. The only truly happy people in the story were Catherine and Heathcliff when they were free in their juvenile love, and then, we can presume young Catherine and Hareton in their freedom to love passionately. Though the amiable Edgar Linton raised young Catherine, she nonetheless took on the “grim and taciturn” nature and “universal scowl” of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights (10). Lockwood on meeting Catherine for the first time notes: 
		<blockquote>[…] eyes -- had they been agreeable in expression, they would have been irresistible -- fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there (9). 
        </blockquote> 
Lockwood, a stranger, foreshadows, in the convoluted chronology of the novel, Cathy’s quite different past. Her environment corrupted her good nature, as it did the potential good nature of all who had lived there. We learn from Lockwood, “it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas,” (10).  If Catherine, bred of the utmost gentility, raised in an ideal environment, was so corrupted so quickly by the loveless environment of the Heights, how was the young orphan Heathcliff, with nothing for comparison nor any initial love sustenance, to fair in that emotional famine? Brontë shows us that anyone would have gone bad, so we can understand why Heathcliff did especially.
	</p>
	<p>One may conclude that of the more significant claims Brontë makes in Wuthering Heights, nurture’s stronger influence over nature must be first among them. One’s actions can’t help but be informed by society’s expectations, if only to help carve out that vision as accepting what is around one or wanting something else. Heathcliff’s dream was to be the Mr. Earnshaw of the manor. Dying alone and enveloped in bitterness like the two Mr. Earnshaw’s before him, we can say he succeeded in his goal tremendously.
